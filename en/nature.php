            Thanks to the establishment of the 2,7 km long meandering river streams and small islands with high vegetation the persecuted and threatened bird species will return. Furthermore, a big amount of the fish in the Iskar reservoir can use the calm river of the new wetland for spawning. Spawning was difficult before that because the biggest part of the dam has steep and barren shores and gives minimal opportunities for that. With implementation of the project countless insects, amphibians and other animals will once again inhabit the area and the unique flora will restore.
